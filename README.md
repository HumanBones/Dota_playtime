# Dota_playtime
Webscraping Dota playtime from Steam


I used tkintek, python GUI toolkit, to make a simple UI, then using beautiful soup 4 and regex to webscrape my friends and my steam profile for Dota 2 playtime then output it in Tkinter UI for compersion.
I also used pyintaller to export it to a .exe file for windows.
